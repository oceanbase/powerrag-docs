# Overview

Langfuse is a comprehensive platform designed for Large Language Model (LLM) application development, providing end-to-end observability and intelligent operations. The platform integrates three core functional modules that together build enterprise-level AI application lifecycle management capabilities.

## Core functional modules

### Application observability

Langfuse has built comprehensive observability capabilities, providing end-to-end tracing and performance analysis for LLM applications. Through visual error analysis, cost tracking, performance monitoring, and other features, it helps developers:

+ Accelerate development and debugging processes
+ Accurately track call costs and token consumption
+ Identify performance bottlenecks and reduce application latency
+ Lay the data foundation for model evaluation

**Technical advantages**: Supports multimodal input tracking, compatible with mainstream model service providers, framework-agnostic integration, multi-language SDK support.

### Prompt management

Prompt management focuses on full lifecycle management of prompts in LLM applications, providing:

+ User-friendly interface, enabling non-technical users to participate in management
+ Decoupled deployment, allowing prompt editing without redeployment
+ Version control and quick rollback capabilities
+ Side-by-side comparison of multiple versions
+ Client-side caching optimization to avoid latency impact

### Application evaluation

The evaluation module provides a comprehensive quality assurance system for LLM applications, supporting:

+ **Offline evaluation**: Use test datasets in controlled environments to obtain clear accuracy metrics
+ **Online evaluation**: Evaluate application performance in real production environments, capturing situations that cannot be anticipated in the lab
+ **Evaluation methods**: Support automatic scoring using LLM-as-a-Judge methods
+ **Dataset benchmarking**: Run benchmarks through SDK or console, supporting parameter comparison and performance analysis

## Platform value

Through the organic combination of three major functions, Langfuse provides enterprise-level AI applications with:

+ **Full-chain transparency**: Complete tracking from prompt input to model output
+ **Quality assurance loop**: Quality monitoring throughout the entire development, testing, and production process
+ **Cost and performance optimization**: Data-driven refined operational decisions
+ **Continuous improvement mechanism**: Drive product iteration through evaluation feedback

## Use cases

+ Development and operations of complex multi-model, multi-agent systems
+ Large-scale deployment of enterprise-level AI applications
+ Production environments requiring strict quality control and cost management
+ Cross-team collaborative LLM application development projects

Combined with OceanBase's advantages in data security and high availability, Langfuse provides enterprises with stable and scalable AI application operations solutions, helping teams build high-quality and trustworthy intelligent applications.
