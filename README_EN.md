# PowerRAG Community Edition Documentation

Welcome to the PowerRAG Community Edition documentation repository. This repository maintains and publishes product documentation related to PowerRAG Community Edition, including documentation for PowerRAG Community Edition and its derivative project Langfuse.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains documentation for two main components:

### 1. PowerRAG Community Edition

PowerRAG Community Edition is an open-source project based on [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow), licensed under the **Apache 2.0** license. Built on top of RAGFlow, it extends capabilities including document services, structured information extraction, multimodal search, and evaluation with feedback, providing comprehensive data services for Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

The PowerRAG Community Edition documentation focuses exclusively on the new and independent capabilities introduced by PowerRAG Community Edition. For features and usage shared with RAGFlow, please refer to the [RAGFlow official documentation](https://ragflow.io/docs/v0.22.0/).

### 2. Langfuse

Langfuse is an independent sub-project within the PowerRAG Community Edition ecosystem, implementing the evaluation and feedback module. It has its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/langfuse), but documentation is consolidated in this repository for centralized developer reference.

Langfuse provides model observability, prompt management, and evaluation capabilities, helping users build monitorable and tunable LLM application systems.
