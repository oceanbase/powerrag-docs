# Playground

Test and iterate on your prompts directly in the Langfuse Prompt Playground. Tweak the prompt and model parameters to see how different models respond to these input changes. This allows you to quickly iterate on your prompts and optimize them for the best results in your LLM app without having to switch between tools or use any code.

## Core features

### Side-by-Side comparison view

Compare multiple prompt variants alongside each other. Execute them all at once or focus on a single variant. Each variant keeps its own LLM settings, variables, tool definitions, and placeholders so you can immediately see the impact of every change.

Take the example of comparing the effects of different values passed to the variable:

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Playground**.
2. Edit prompt. Insert variables in the `{{variable}}` format.
3. After variables are inserted, the number of variables are displayed above. Click on the number and enter a value for each variable in the pop-up. Click **Submit** to obtain the corresponding output.
4. Click ![](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/powerrag/langfuse/icon3.png) in the upper right corner. Another input/output window will appear on the right. Click on the number of variables again, and enter another value for each variable in the pop-up. Click **Submit** to obtain the corresponding output.
5. Compare the two outputs.

### Open your prompt in the playground

You can open a prompt you created with [Langfuse Prompt Management](../10.Get%20started.md) in the playground.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Prompts**.
2. Click the prompt name to go to the prompt details page.
3. Select **Playground** > **Fresh playground** in the upper right corner to open the prompt on the playground page.  
If you select **Playground** > **Add to existing**, the Playground page will open a new input/output window to the right of the existing prompt for this prompt.

### Save your prompt to prompt management

When you're satisfied with your prompt, you can save it to prompt management by clicking the save button.

1. Click ![](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/powerrag/langfuse/icon4.png) in the upper right corner. Click **Save as new prompt** to go to the prompt edit page.
2. Enter the prompt name. Configure Config and Labels.
3. Click **Create prompt**.

### Tool calling and structured outputs

The Langfuse Playground supports tool calling and structured output schemas, enabling you to define, test, and validate LLM executions that rely on tool calls and enforce specific response formats.

Currently, Langfuse supports opening tool-type observations in the playground only when they are in the OpenAI ChatML format.

**Tool Calling**

- Define custom tools with JSON schema definitions
- Test prompts relying on tools in real-time by mocking tool responses
- Save tool definitions to your project

**Structured Output**

- Enforce response formats using JSON schemas
- Save schemas to your project
- Jump into the playground from your OpenAI generation using structured output

Please contact Technical Support for detailed instructions.

### Add prompt variables

You can add prompt variables in the playground to simulate different inputs to your prompt.

For detailed instructions, see the "Side-by-Side comparison view" section.

### Use your favorite model

You can use your favorite model by adding the API key for the model you want to use in the Langfuse project settings. For how to set up an LLM connection, see [Configure an LLM connection](../../40.Evaluation/30.Configure%20an%20LLM%20connection.md).

1. Select a model from the list.
