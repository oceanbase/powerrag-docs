# Overview

The application evaluation and observability module provides evaluation and observability capabilities for the PowerRAG platform. This module includes two independent but collaborative service components:

+ **Langfuse Service**: Responsible for collecting and analyzing model runtime data, providing visual observability, evaluation, and prompt management capabilities.
+ **Bridge Service**: Acts as a middleware layer, responsible for processing evaluation data and invoking RAG applications, as well as evaluating invocation results.

You must complete the deployment of both components above before you can use the **Application Observability** and **Application Evaluation** features in the PowerRAG console.

## Prerequisites

Before starting deployment, ensure that:

+ **PowerRAG platform** deployment and initialization have been completed.
+ The current environment has basic container runtime capabilities (Docker).
+ You have PowerRAG console access permissions.

## Deployment order

The recommended deployment order for the application evaluation and observability module is as follows:

1. Deploy **Langfuse Service**. For specific operations, please refer to [Deploy Langfuse](10.Deploy%20Langfuse%20Service.md).
2. **Register a user** and **create an API key** in the Langfuse console.
3. Deploy **Bridge Service**.

After completing the deployment, you need to modify the PowerRAG configuration to configure Langfuse connection and key information. Then you can access the **Observability** and **Evaluation** entries in the PowerRAG console for use.
