# Overview

PowerRAG Community Edition is an open-source project based on [RAGFlow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow), licensed under the Apache License 2.0. While preserving RAGFlow's core capabilities and interface compatibility, PowerRAG Community Edition extends functionality including document processing, structured information extraction, and evaluation with feedback, aiming to provide a more comprehensive integrated data service engine for Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

PowerRAG Community Edition targets developers and research teams building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. Through atomic API design, it can be flexibly embedded into various intelligent applications, supporting rapid development, monitoring, and optimization of question-answering, knowledge extraction, and generation systems based on large models.

## Relationship with RAGFlow

PowerRAG Community Edition natively maintains compatibility with RAGFlow's access interfaces and can directly reuse its APIs, SDKs, and documentation. In the overall architecture, RAGFlow remains the underlying foundational service framework, while PowerRAG Community Edition provides extended capabilities and enhanced components on top of it.

> **Note**  
> PowerRAG Community Edition documentation focuses exclusively on the new and independent capabilities introduced by PowerRAG Community Edition. For features and usage shared with RAGFlow, please refer to the [RAGFlow official documentation](https://ragflow.io/docs/v0.22.0/).

## New Features and Enhanced Modules

### 1. Document Services

Building on RAGFlow's document processing capabilities, PowerRAG adds multi-engine and multi-mode support for more complex document scenarios:

* **Multi-engine OCR Support**: Integrates [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU) and [Dots.OCR](https://github.com/rednote-hilab/dots.ocr) to support recognition and text extraction from complex documents.  
* **Multiple Chunking Strategies**: Supports chunking methods based on headings, regular expressions, and intelligent chunking algorithms, improving content organization and retrieval efficiency.  
* **Structured Information Extraction**: Implements structured information recognition and extraction based on [LangExtract](https://github.com/google/langextract), supporting extraction of structured content such as tables, fields, and entities from documents, providing a data foundation for knowledge graphs and semantic search.

### 2. Hybrid Search

PowerRAG's application platform is built on **OceanBase's multi-modal integrated database architecture (SQL + NoSQL)**, fully leveraging OceanBase's high performance, scalability, and hybrid storage capabilities to provide high-performance underlying support for intelligent search and knowledge services.

* **Hybrid Index Search**: With support from OceanBase 4.4.1 capabilities, implements joint queries of vector indexes and full-text indexes, combining semantic relevance with keyword matching to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information retrieval.  
* **Multi-modal Data Search**: Introduces scalar conditions on top of vector search, enabling further filtering based on numerical, temporal, or categorical attributes within semantic results, achieving precise control over result ranking and filtering.  
* **Unified Data Access Layer**: Through OceanBase's multi-modal integrated interface, uniformly manages text, vector, and structured data, enabling efficient cross-modal and cross-type queries.

This capability enables PowerRAG to provide more flexible knowledge access patterns across multiple types of knowledge sources and complex search scenarios, delivering efficient and scalable underlying data support for large model applications.

### 3. Evaluation and Feedback

PowerRAG Community Edition introduces an evaluation and feedback module to help developers systematically measure and optimize the effectiveness of LLM applications, forming an observable, analyzable, and improvable closed-loop system. This module includes the following core capabilities:

* **Observability**: Provides end-to-end call chain tracing and performance analysis. Developers can gain comprehensive insights into the entire model inference process, including inputs and outputs, tool calls, retry processes, latency, and call costs, supporting model performance optimization and cost control.  
* **Prompt Management**: Supports storage, version management, and retrieval of prompts, facilitating team collaboration on prompt tuning, sharing, and reuse, achieving standardization and traceability in prompt design.  
* **Evaluation**: Provides multiple evaluation methods, supporting effectiveness verification and quality comparison of model outputs at different stages, helping teams achieve continuous optimization and automated testing.

Through this module, PowerRAG can achieve a complete feedback loop from data input and prompt design to effect evaluation during model development and application, helping teams improve model interpretability and application quality.

## Open Source and Ecosystem

PowerRAG Community Edition is released as open source, continuously incorporating community contributions for improvement. Through open interface design and modular architecture, PowerRAG not only supports plugin-based integration within the RAGFlow ecosystem but also encourages developers to extend more data services and evaluation modules.
