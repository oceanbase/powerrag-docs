# Overview

PowerRAG has built comprehensive observability capabilities, providing end-to-end tracing and performance analysis for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Through observability features, you can gain comprehensive insights into the entire model inference process, including inputs, outputs, tool calls, retry processes, latency, and the cost of each call.

## Why do you need tracing?

In complex multi-model, multi-agent systems, model behavior is often difficult to predict. Through tracing, you can achieve system-level transparency and controllability, thereby:

+ **Accelerate development and debugging**: Through visual error analysis (such as: abnormal responses, inefficient prompts, invalid retries, etc.), quickly understand the performance of models or agents during runtime, improving iteration efficiency.
+ **Track call costs**: Accurately record token consumption and costs for each model call, providing data support for cost optimization and resource planning.
+ **Reduce application latency**: By analyzing various stages of the trace (model responses, API calls, external tool interactions), identify performance bottlenecks and reduce overall latency.
+ **Lay the foundation for model evaluation**: Trace data can serve as a foundational data source for subsequent evaluation systems (such as effectiveness scoring, quality comparison, A/B testing).
+ **Save support and operations time**: In customer support or troubleshooting scenarios, quickly reproduce issues through traces, reducing manual localization and fix time.

## Why choose PowerRAG's observability capabilities?

Combined with OceanBase's advantages in data security and high availability, PowerRAG provides more stable and scalable observability solutions for enterprise-level AI applications.

+ **Multimodal support**: In addition to text, PowerRAG also supports tracking and analysis of multimodal inputs such as images, audio, and video, helping users fully understand complex interaction scenarios.
+ **Multi-model compatibility**: Compatible with mainstream model service providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude, Qwen, InternLM, etc.), enabling cross-model tracking of call performance and costs.
+ **Framework agnostic**: Supports integration with common frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDK, and can seamlessly integrate with PowerRAG's workflow orchestration capabilities.
+ **Multi-language support**: Supports SDKs in multiple languages such as Python and JavaScript, facilitating unified implementation of tracking and monitoring across different technology stacks.
