# Prompts management overview

Prompt management is a systematic approach to storing, versioning and retrieving prompts in LLM applications.

## Why prompt management?

- Involve non-technical users through UI
- Decoupling: edit prompts without redeploying
- Quickly rollback to a previous version of a prompt
- Compare different prompt versions side-by-side
- No latency/availability impact due to client-side caching
