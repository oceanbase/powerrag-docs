# Access Langfuse and create API key

Langfuse Service implements external authentication and access control through API keys. The Bridge Service needs to use this key to communicate with Langfuse, thereby enabling evaluation and observability features. This section describes how to create an API key in the Langfuse console.

## Prerequisites

## Procedure

1. Log in to the PowerRAG console, and click **Observability** in the left navigation bar to access the Langfuse console.
2. On the registration page, fill in **Name**, **Email**, and **Password** to complete new account registration.
3. Log in to the Langfuse console, click **Organization** in the left navigation bar, then click **+ New Organization** in the upper right corner of the page.
4. Follow the page prompts to complete organization creation, member invitation, and project creation.
5. On the **4. Set up tracking** page, click **Create API Key** to generate your project key.
